This project was made using Visual Studio Code 2022 on the Windows 10 operating system.

Instructions for building and running the solution.
1. Open "Command Prompt" application
2. Change the current directory to that of the extracted archive
3. Run 'msbuild' command (PATH variable with the value of 'MsBuild.exe' parent directory needs to be added)
4. On my own computer, step number no. 3 creates the directory "x64/Debug" where the resulting executable is located.
For testing purposes I have written a batch script "cmd_script.bat" that runs the resulting executable file with various parameters.
In order for it to work, the value of the "progam_file_directory" environment vaiable (inside "cmd_script.bat") has to be set to the relative path 
of a directory where the executable file is located (in my case "x64/Debug").
5. Since the batch script doesn't write its output into the filesystem, running it from the command prompt is recommended.
